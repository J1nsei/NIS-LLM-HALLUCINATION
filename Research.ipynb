      "Background:\n",
      "The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution reads: \"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"  This language has created considerable debate regarding the Amendment's intended scope. On one hand, some believe that the Amendment's phrase \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms\" creates an individual constitutional right to possess firearms.  On the other hand, some scholars point to the prefatory language \"a well regulated Militia\" to argue that the Framers intended only to restrict Congress from legislating away a state's right to self-defense.  This is known as the \"collective rights theory.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Participant's Explanation:\n",
      "The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution is a fundamental right that protects the individual's right to keep and bear arms. The text of the amendment states that \"the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\" This right is considered an individual right, rather than a collective right, and is protected by the Constitution. The Second Amendment has been the subject of much debate and interpretation, with some arguing that it only applies to the context of a well-regulated militia, while others argue that it protects an individual's right to self-defense and the defense of their home. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Second Amendment does protect an individual's right to possess a firearm, but the scope of that right is still a matter of ongoing legal debate and interpretation.\n",

      "Award a score of \"4-6 (Average)\" if the participant's explanation of the concept is partially correct but lacks essential details.\n",
      "Award a score of \"1-3 (Poor)\" if the participant's explanation of the concept is incorrect or includes obvious errors.\n",
